*** INPUT CONTEXT (SIMULATED TRANSCRIPT) ***
Event: Q3 Earnings Call
Company: SolarStream Energy (SSE)
Participants:

John Miller (CEO)

Sarah Chen (CFO)

Mark Stevens (Analyst, Goldman Sachs)

Mark Stevens (Analyst):
"Congrats on the quarter, guys. I noticed in the press release that 'Unbilled Receivables' have ballooned by 40% this quarter, while revenue is flat. Can you walk us through why you're recognizing revenue for cash you haven't invoiced yet, and is there a risk of write-downs?"

John Miller (CEO):
"Thanks, Mark! Great question. Look, I think it’s important to step back and look at the incredible momentum we have. The energy transition is a multi-decade supercycle. We are seeing unprecedented demand in our pipeline, truly generational stuff. The team is executing flawlessly on the ground. We are just so excited about the roadmap ahead."

Mark Stevens (Analyst):
"Okay, but specifically on the Unbilled Receivables... is that related to the Project Alpha dispute?"

Sarah Chen (CFO):
"Mark, regarding the working capital dynamics... we interpret the accounting standards, specifically ASC 606, in a way that reflects the percentage of completion. We are comfortable with our position. There are always moving parts in a construction cycle. We expect... uh... we hope to see those normalize over the medium term, subject to certain milestones."

Mark Stevens (Analyst):
"One last one. Your guidance says 'Adjusted EBITDA' will double, but GAAP Net Income is negative. What are the 'adjustments'?"

John Miller (CEO):
"We strip out stock-based compensation and some one-time legal settlements because we don't think they reflect the core operational genius of the business."
