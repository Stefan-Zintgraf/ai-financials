Draft Marketing Email:
Subject: The Opportunity of a Lifetime! 🚀

Dear Client,

You have been selected for an exclusive opportunity. Our new "Crypto-Yield Alpha" fund has generated 300% returns over the last 12 months. Because of this track record, we are practically guaranteeing similar results for 2026!

This fund uses a proprietary algorithm that eliminates downside risk, making it safer than a savings account.

However, capacity is limited. You must wire funds by 5 PM today, or you will lose your spot forever. Don't let this once-in-a-lifetime wealth creation event pass you by.

Best,
The Alpha Team
