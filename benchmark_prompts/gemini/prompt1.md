*** INPUT CONTEXT (SIMULATED 10-K EXCERPT) ***
Company: Orion Cybernetics (Ticker: ORCY)
Period: Fiscal Year Ended Dec 31, 2025

Management Discussion and Analysis:
During fiscal year 2025, Orion Cybernetics faced a transformative yet turbulent environment. Total revenue decreased by 4.2% to $840 million, primarily driven by a 15% contraction in our Legacy Hardware segment. While our new "Neural-Link" cloud subscription service grew by 45% YoY to $200 million, it was not enough to offset the decline in physical server sales.

Liquidity remains a focal point for investors. As of December 31, 2025, our Cash and Cash Equivalents stood at $45 million, with Marketable Securities totaling $15 million. Accounts Receivable were $60 million. On the liability side, Current Liabilities totaled $180 million, including a $50 million bridge loan due in March 2026. We are currently in negotiations to refinance this facility, but as of the date of this report, no definitive agreement has been signed. Failure to refinance this debt could trigger cross-default provisions in our long-term bonds.

Regarding our supply chain, we have consolidated 80% of our GPU procurement to a single supplier, "SiliconFoundry Corp," located in the Pacific Rim. While this has improved gross margins by 200 basis points, recent geopolitical tensions in that region have caused minor shipping delays. A complete embargo or trade blockade in that region would halt our production capabilities within 3 weeks, as we operate on a Just-In-Time inventory model.

Strategically, we are executing a "hard pivot." We intend to divest the entire Legacy Hardware division by Q4 2026. Proceeds will be used to fund the acquisition of "Aether AI," a generative text startup. This divestiture will likely result in a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $120 million next quarter. We believe this is necessary to transition Orion into a pure-play software entity, even if it results in short-term revenue volatility and the loss of our 20-year relationship with government defense contracts that rely on our hardware.
